# Poly Tips and Tricks

Here you'll find various helpful information to navigate your journey at Polytechnique Montreal more effectively.

## Grade Report Annotations (Liens sur les relevés de notes)

When reviewing your grade report, you'll notice various annotations next to your courses. Here's what they mean:

- **OB**: Obligatoire (Mandatory) - Required course for your program  
- **OP**: Optionnel (Optional) - Optional course that counts towards your program  
- **EX**: Excédentaire (Excess) - Course beyond program requirements  
- **AC**: Autres crédits (Other Credits) - Other credits that count towards your program  

The following annotations indicate courses that don't count towards your GPA or credit total:

- **HP**: Hors programme (Out of Program) - Course not part of your program  
- **CC**: Crédits complémentaires (Complementary Credits) - Additional credits  
- **RA**: Requis à l'admission (Required for Admission) - Prerequisites needed for admission

## Strategic Credit Load Planning

Poly's workload can be intense. Many students recommend taking around **12 credits per semester** when possible (4 courses) instead of 15.  
This gives more balance for internships, clubs, job search, and mental health—especially in early years.

Tip: Use summers or one lighter term to stay on track instead of pushing 5 heavy courses back-to-back.

## Community & Language Strategy (Anglophones / International Students)

Poly is francophone-first, but bilingual life is very possible.  
International/English-speaking students often thrive by actively joining student clubs, lab groups, and cultural associations.

Tip: Treat learning French as a career investment — it opens doors in Québec tech & engineering roles.

## Choosing Courses Based on Workload & Prof Variation

Not all electives or course sections are equal. Some are lighter but still useful, others are notoriously demanding.  
Before registering, ask upper-year students or check community feedback.

Tip: Plan electives early to avoid stacking 3-4 heavy technical classes in one term.

## Internship Success Strategy (Start Early)

Landing internships at Poly is competitive — especially first year.  
Going to career fairs early, having CVs ready, and networking with reps/alumni helps massively.

Tip: Track companies on SPOT, LinkedIn, and La Ruche; tailor each application; attend fairs even if you “feel too early.”

## Part-Time Internships: A Smart Career Move

Balancing part-time internships with schoolwork can be one of the smartest decisions you make.  
It’s great money, fantastic for your resume, and keeps a foot in the door at a company you might want to join full-time later.

Tip: Discuss part-time options with your internship supervisor. Many companies are open to flexible arrangements for students.

## Know Poly’s Style: Theory-Heavy Curriculum

Poly emphasizes strong theory foundations vs some more applied universities.  
Expect heavy math, physics, and theoretical depth — especially early on.

Tip: Compensate with practical experience: clubs (robotics/AI), personal projects, hackathons, internships.

## Smart Note-Taking & Knowledge Indexing

Build organized notes from day one — they become gold when earlier subjects reappear in later terms (they will).  

Tip: Create a searchable digital system (Notion, Obsidian, OneNote) organized by:  
- course  
- key formulas  
- tricky proofs  
- exam-relevant tricks  

---

## Clubs & Student Groups = Secret Career Advantage

Joining a technical club or student organization massively boosts skills, connections, and internship prospects.  

Tip: Attend intro sessions first term and join at least one technical + one social/community group.

---

## Electives with Future Job Goals in Mind

Don’t just pick electives based on “easy profs.” Choose ones aligned with what you want to do after graduating (AI, aerospace, embedded, etc.).

Tip: Map future courses to career paths early; plan key electives before the final year rush.
